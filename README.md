# Road Lane Line Detection

The "Road Lane Line Detection" repository contains scripts and resources for developing a system that detects lane lines on roads using image processing techniques. This tool is essential for autonomous driving and driver assistance systems, ensuring safe navigation by identifying lane boundaries accurately.

## Features

- **Lane Detection**: Identify lane lines on roads using edge detection and Hough transform techniques.
- **Video Processing**: Process video streams to continuously monitor lane positions.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Display detected lanes on video frames in real-time.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- MoviePy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Road-Lane-Line-Detection.git
   cd Road-Lane-Line-Detection

2.Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib moviepy
   ```
3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
  ```bash
  jupyter-notebook
  ```
 
 
## Usage
1.Open the Jupyter Notebook file.
2.Load the sample video or image files.
3.Run the script to detect and visualize lane lines on the road.
